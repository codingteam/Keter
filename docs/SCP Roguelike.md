SCP Roguelike
=============

This document deals with broad considerations and high-level concepts.

# Content

## Setting

Concepts and definitive content will be... borrowed from the SCP shared 'verse, but details (SCP objects, their properties, characters and the like) will be homebrewn, except for iconic characters(Dr. Clef, Dr. Kondraki, agent Strelnikov, etc) and SCPs (682, 173, 500...), that should be transferred faithfully to the source.

Game world will be generated randomly for each playthrough.

## Presentation

Primary implementation is ASCII pseudographics. Tile graphics are optional and low-priority.

# Game modes

## Containment breach

Action occurs in a randomly-generated multi-level Foundation Area that is occupied by an out-of-control SCP. The goal of a player will be to:
* Delve into SCP-ridden depths; then
* Find a nuclear device arming key and "reestablish containment";
*OR*
* Reestablish containment the old-fashioned way, by duking it out with The Keter motherf█████ that started this mess;
*AND, OPTIONALLY*
* Survive.

## Missions mode

A player character performs missions assigned by her supervisors, rises in rank, power, equipment access and insanity. Some of the possible mission types are:
* Containment breach -- identical to the eponymous game mode
* Area attack -- attack on a FOB of a rival world conspiracy: blast through the defences, get to the control room and geek the local boss.
* Area defence -- do not let rival world conspiracy agents to do the same on you
* Area exploration -- explore the pocket dimension/internals of a giant SCP/the other side of a portal
* Object containment -- secure and contain (or destroy) an actively opposing anomalous entity
* Raid -- ~~steal~~ acquire an object of interest from a rival world conspiracy

# Factions

Factions should be described on the following terms:
* Equipment access: guns, armor, tanks, orbital killsats, etc
* Equipment quality: A rusty AK is better than nothing. But there are better alternatives.
* Anomalous objects access: how many objects organization has and how willing it is to use them
* Combat ability: how good organization members are at dishing out harm and surviving
* Special traits
