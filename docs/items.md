## Usable items

* Frag grenade
A portable single-use IQ test. Push the lever, pull the pin, count to three and throw it at the enemy. If you're smart enough understand what "it" means, you'll live. Maybe.

* Flashbang
Lets out a bright flash and a loud bang. Can give you that extra few seconds you need, provided that mostrosities you threw that flashbang at actually use their eyes and ears.

* Med kit
Wound dressings, sutures and antiseptic spray that you'll need to turn a fast bleedout into a slow one.
