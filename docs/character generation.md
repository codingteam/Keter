Character Generation
====================

# Name
As is obvious, a user should be permitted to enter a name for his character.

# Faction
After entering a name a player will be presented with a faction select menu. Said menu should allow the player to navigate through the list of available factions and display faction details on the same screen.

# Stats
Stats should be randomly generated by rolling a number of dice. Number and value of dice is defined by a chosen faction or, more precisely, faction's combat ability as follows:

Combat ability | Str | Dex | IQ
-------------- | --- | --- | ---
 Low           | 2d6 | 3d6 | 3d6
 Medium        | 3d6 | 3d6 | 3d6
 High          | 4d6 | 4d6 | 3d6
 
If the player finds a particular set of stats undesirable, a character can be rerolled up to 3 times per character creation.

Character's maximum health points is defined as 10+Str
 
# Equipment
After accepting rolled stats the player will select equipment for his character by spending requisition points (RPs). How many RPs he can spend is defined by a faction's equipment availability grade:

Equipment availability | RPs
---------------------- | ---
 None                  | 0
 Low                   | 150
 Medium                | 250
 High                  | 350
 
Available equipment is constrained by the faction's equipment quality grade. Equipment quality thresholds are listed in the items description.
